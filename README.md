We are an early-stage bioinformatics startup building a cloud-based platform for genomic and pharmacogenomics data analysis and research workflows.

We are currently developing an MVP and evaluating the Claude API as a core component for scientific text analysis, data summarization, research assistance, and interpretation of complex biological datasets.

We are reaching out to request startup credits to support development, testing, and early pilot usage. Access to credits would significantly accelerate our experimentation and validation of Claude within our platform.

We would also appreciate guidance on best practices for integrating Claude into research-focused applications.
